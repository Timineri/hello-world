    <P>This first person that came to my mind when asked to write this tribute is you mommy, and I'm 
    using this opportunity to say a big thank you for being my source of motivation and inspiration, 
    for being my encouragement, for being a strong tree that i can always lean on, for being my first
    teacher, for being my disciplinarian, for being my channel to the world, for being there when i 
    needed you the most, for being a friend and most importantly for being my mother.<br>
    You've been there when i needed someone to cry with, to laugh with, to play with, to talk with,
    to dance with, to quarrel with, to crack jokes with and much more. You've never left me hanging
    and i want to say i love you so much and i pray God keeps us alive to let me take care of you till
    the end just as you have taken care of me without thinking twice.<br>
    You are the Best!!!
